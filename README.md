# TODO: Todo app

On a sundaymorning you woke up with a genious idea. Let's make a todo app! 
This idea has never been done before so it must be one of those one billion dollar ideas.

## TODO: install packages and start

1. run `npm install`
2. run `npm start`

## TODO: The actual work

 1. Add input component that adds an item on enter
 2. Show the entered items in the MyList component
 3. Bonus objective: Add button to remove item from the list
